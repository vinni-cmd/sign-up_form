# sign-up_form

The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS PROJECT: SIGN-UP FORM

Some initial observations:
*Multiple flex-box containers
*Main container occupies about 50-60% of body width
*Image area occupies about... Why keep on guessing and just measure image
*Placeholder text is blank or consists of a space
*Form control in :focus has a blue border
*Password inputs have red border when placeholder present, when not matching and likely also when pattern requirements are not met
\*Create account button could be outside of form container (linked with form attribute) or login option is just a div included in form

-

Some enhancement ideas:
*Begin with mobile first lay-out (use image as background and stack rest vertically)
*Add regex pattern for password
*Add checkboxes to indicate acceptable input
*Maybe phone number should not be required but if entered it should be 9 digits long or have some min and or max
